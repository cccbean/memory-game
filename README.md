# Odoin Project: Memory Game
- Got a working memory game using React based closely on the example they provided.
- Application only has basic styling for now since I didn't feel like making design decisions

## What I learned
- How to implement API calls using useEffect
- Got more practice with useState, React event listeners, useEffect with localstorage
- Used the HTML <dialog> for the first time and it's really nice

## Potential Changes
- Could add inputs that let you pick the number of cards for the game
  - Already know how to implement this, just didn't feel like doing so
  - An easy way to increase the difficulty of the game
- Nicer styling
